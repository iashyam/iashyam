# Hello There

My name is __Shyam Sunder__ and I am a Physics Student in St. Stephen's College, New Delhi. 

I have interest in Prpgramming since my college and from last year I am enjoying it very much. 

I like computational Physics because I believe that hard Physics Problems that can't be done on paper can easily solved using a computer with the help of efective algortithems. So I am learning various algorithms.

I have also done some Web Development... I do sometimes for stress release.

My Programming skills include

1. Python
1. C++
1. Fortran

and also

4. HTML 
5. CSS

Feel free to start a project with me!! Happy learning..
