## Introduction
Driven by a deep passion for physics and strong programming skills, my enthusiasm lies at the heart of solving
complex problems, particularly in statistical mechanics. While my programming skills are robust, my true devotion
is to the world of physics. I am committed to utilizing my programming insight to push the boundaries of what is
possible in this exciting discipline.

## Projects
### __Self Propulsion of Active Droplet Under Chemical Reaction__

* Showing Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in Binary Fluid using _Active Model H_.
* Implemented Spectral Method to solve coupled differential equations in three fields and simulate their dynamics in
Python.
* Simulated the self-propulsion of an Active Droplet under a dilute chemical field and low Reynolds’s number
approximation

### __Monte Carlo Simulations__

+ Implemented Metropolis Algorithm to simulate the Ising Model in python.
+ Verify the phase transition in the presence and absence of a magnetic field. Calculated the critical temperature for the
2-D and 3-D Ising models.
+ Showed the temperature dependence of magnetic moment and susceptibility.
+ Tested the model for various scales and verified the scaling hypothesis.

### __Simulatios for Ensambles__
+ __Micro-canonical Ensemble simulation:__ Showed the Maxwellian distribution of velocity among hard spheres in a box
with weak interactions. Used Newton’s Laws to simulate the dynamics.
+ __Leonard-Jones Fluid:__ Did the simulation for hard-spheres in a box interacting through Leonard-Jones potential.
+ __Canonical Ensemble simulation:__ Applied the Thermostat method to fix the temperature of Leonard-Jones Fluid.
Showed phase transition in the fluid.

## Other Programming Projects

### __Serial Port Reader__

+ Reading continuous data from serial port using _Arduino_.
+ Storing the data in Excel sheets.
+ Elementry analysis of data using _Pandas_ and plotting the results.
+ Designing a GUI for automating the process. 

### __API Based Project__

+ Getting data using Blogger API. And extracting relevant data using JSON. 
+ Getting data and posting on Instagram using Meta API. 
+ Building automated software for posting on Instagram whenever I make a new blog post. 

### __Machine Learning Based Project__

+ Training a simple Neural Network to find the roots of a polynomial equation. 
+ Training a simple Nueral Network for solve 1-D diffrential Equation.(UF)
+ More to be added in future. 

### __Web Development Based Project__:

+ Simple portfolio or someone in a modeling career. 
+ Adding small features and developments to my own HUGO website. 
+ Built a small website for myself using HTML and CSS. 
+ More to be added in the future.

### __Other Self Projects__:
+ __Lisaajoo’s figures:__ An interactive GUI software to draw Lisaajoo’s figures for any general case.
+ __Web Scrapper:__ A web scrapping tool that automatically creates a new GitHub repo on my account whenever I start a new project.
It works on the Linux platform and uses Linux shell scripts.
+ __Sudoku:__ Made a simple sudoku game using GUI in Python.
